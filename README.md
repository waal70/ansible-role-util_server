waal70.util_server
=========

Installs pihole on a dummy network interface (it assumes you have some other DNS running).  
Installs tftp to host the trivial FTP server in order to enable network booting.  
It will download the Debian netboot image, and place it into the appropriate folder for the tftp-server.  
It will configure the netboot image, in order to set some defaults, SAY things to the user and use a preseed.cfg for Debian installs.  
If requested, it will purge the pihole adlist database and repopulate, using mongodb commands.

Requirements
------------

Assumes you have some form of DNS running on the proper network interface (e.g. samba DNS)  
In pihole.yml, a reference is made to a client list with custom DNS entries. For now it defaults to
    ~/ansible/home/inventory/client.list
An example file is provided in this role's files folder (custom.list)  
Change the location in the task or make sure you provide the file  
It also presumes a passwordless web GUI. If you do not want this, please change
    setupVars.conf.j2
in the templates folder of this role

Role Variables
--------------

Maximum age of the netboot image. If the currently installed netboot image is older than this, it will re-download
    netboot_max_age: "98d"
    netboot_url: ["https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bookworm/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz"]

    install_pihole: false # switch to (re-)install pihole

The name of the dummy interface
    iface_dummy: "eth53"
    iface_dummy_private_ipv4: "10.1.1.4"
    iface_dummy_private_ipv6: "2a10:3781:3623:d0::1/64"

My provider documents these on [https://freedom.nl/page/servers], use your own if needed  
Forwarder 1 and 2 are required
    forward_dns_1: "185.93.175.43" # Google would be 8.8.8.8
    forward_dns_2: "185.232.98.76" # Google would be 8.8.4.4
Use 3 and 4 for IPv6. You can also leave them empty  
    forward_dns_3: "2a10:3780:2:52:185:93:175:43"
    forward_dns_4: "2a10:3780:2:53:185:232:98:76"

The json (in pihole export format) for the adlists. If you wish to add adlists, do that here so that this script may install
    adlists: "{{ lookup('file', 'myadlist.json') | from_json }}"

Various whitelists and blacklists, in both exact and regex forms. Again, these adhere to the pihole-export format, for your convenience
    wl_exact: "{{ lookup('file', 'whitelist-exact.json') | from_json }}"
    wl_regex: "{{ lookup('file', 'whitelist-regex.json') | from_json }}"
    bl_exact: "{{ lookup('file', 'blacklist-exact.json') | from_json }}"
    bl_regex: "{{ lookup('file', 'blacklist-regex.json') | from_json }}"

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - waal70.util_serverS
